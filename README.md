# brute-force

The purpose of this code is for educational purposes only.  Also, using pure
Python for time sensitive applications isn't recommended.

To use this code, create a wrapper function in Python which returns a boolean
for whether the current brute force guess is correct.  Also specify a list of
strings out from which to build passwords.  You can search a dictionary of
commonly used passwords in this way for a match.
